Consider things I learned from my first project:

# Page sizing

**Grid comparison:** put your image into grid layout for measuring all the divisions and containers (idk how)

**Boxes and lines:** create division boxes for an idea for how you'll create your html struct and put some lines in another picture so that you'vr idea for how things will cross each other suppose navbar and website title are horizontally aligned.

**Screen size:** compare design pic size.with your laptop screen size for an idea that how things will align together.

**Responsive:** imagine the same web on mobile so you've an idea that the design is compatible for phone screens or not, also remember that create your whole webpage Responsive from starting.

# Pre-defined structure
Imagine your whole page using grid comparison, boxes and lines, screen size and responsive web and then pre-define that how many divs and classes you're going to use and do them in Emmet abbreviations for eg.
```html
ul.playlist-ul>(li.navmrg-li>a.navlink-a)*5
```
The upper Emmet stands for unordered list that has `playlist-ul` class, list items stands list items that has `navmrg-li` class and a stands for `<a>` tag that has `navlink-a` class.
Did you notice that upper all class has their tag name like `<ul>` has `playlist-ul` it is for better css classification, for your better understanding of which class is this?

Get help of chat-GPT for some formatting and creating some javascript Functions.

# Notes and resources
Create a special folder (that is located on desktop so you can directly access) put your all images and resources in this folder for anytime access, revise your all notes before starting a project and get all things organised before project so thing did not messed up.

# Firefox is better option
Use Firefox instead of chrome, because of advance CSS editing features.
