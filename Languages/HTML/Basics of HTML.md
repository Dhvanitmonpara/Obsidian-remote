HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It consists of various elements that structure and format content on a webpage.

## HTML Document Structure

An HTML document is composed of several key components:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version.
- `<html>`: The root element that encapsulates the entire document.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document.
  - `<meta>`: Provides metadata like character encoding and viewport settings.
  - `<title>`: Sets the title of the webpage (displayed in the browser tab).
- `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the webpage.

## HTML Elements

HTML elements are used to define different parts of a webpage. They consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag (in some cases).

- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph.
- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`: Define headings with decreasing levels of importance.
- `<a href="URL">`: Creates a hyperlink to another webpage or resource.
- `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">`: Embeds an image with optional alt text.
- `<ul>` and `<ol>`: Create unordered and ordered lists, respectively.
  - `<li>`: Represents list items within `<ul>` or `<ol>`.
- `<div>`: Defines a division or section of the page.
- `<span>`: Used for inline styling or targeting specific elements within larger blocks.
- `<br>`: Inserts a line break.
- `<hr>`: Adds a horizontal line.

## HTML Attributes

HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information or modify their behavior:

- `class="classname"`: Assigns a class to an element for styling with CSS.
- `id="elementid"`: Provides a unique identifier for an element.
- `src="source"`: Specifies the source (e.g., image URL) for elements like images or iframes.
- `href="link"`: Defines the URL for hyperlinks.
- `alt="description"`: Provides alternative text for images (useful for accessibility).
- `style="CSS properties"`: Allows inline CSS styling.

## HTML Comments

Comments in HTML are used to add notes or explanations within the code:

```html
<!-- This is an HTML comment -->
```

The shortcut key for is `ctrl`+`/(slash)`
## HTML Formatting

HTML can be used to format text:

- `<strong>`: Indicates strong importance (typically renders as bold).
- `<em>`: Emphasizes text (typically renders as italic).
- `<u>`: Underlines text (not recommended; use CSS for styling).

## HTML Forms

HTML forms are used for user input and data submission:

- `<form action="submit.php" method="post">`: Defines a form with submission settings.
- `<input type="text" name="username">`: Creates a text input field.
- `<input type="password" name="password">`: Creates a password input field.
- `<input type="submit" value="Submit">`: Adds a submit button.

These are the fundamental concepts of HTML. Learning HTML is essential for web development and creating web pages.
