# What is Data?
Data is the collection of raw bytes, It does not carry any specific purpose and has no significance by itself.
Moreover, data is measured in terms of bits and bytes - which are basic units of information in the context of computer storage and processing.

> Data can be recorded and doesn't has any meaning unless processed.

Database is location or base of data where data has been stored.

# DBMS vs File Systems

## File-processing systems have major disadvantages:

1. **Data Redundancy and inconsistency:** Data is duplicated and can lead to inconsistencies.

2. **Difficulty in accessing data:** Retrieving data can be cumbersome and slow.

3. **Data isolation:** Data in one file is isolated from data in another file.

4. **Integrity problems:** Ensuring data accuracy and consistency is challenging.

5. **Atomicity problems:** Transaction completeness is not guaranteed.

6. **Concurrent-access anomalies:** Multiple users can cause data inconsistencies.

7. **Security problems:** Limited control over data access.

## Advantages of DBMS (answers to "Why use DBMS?"):

1. **Data Redundancy and inconsistency are minimized:** Data is centrally managed, reducing duplication.

2. **Data is easily accessible:** Queries and retrieval are streamlined.

3. **Data isolation is reduced:** Data is integrated for better relationships.

4. **Data integrity is maintained:** Enforces data accuracy and consistency.

5. **Atomicity of transactions is ensured:** Transactions are all-or-nothing.

6. **Concurrent-access anomalies are managed:** Conflicting data access is controlled.

7. **Security is improved:** Access control and data protection are enhanced.
