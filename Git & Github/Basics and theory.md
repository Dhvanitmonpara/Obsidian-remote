# Theory

In commit `Author` represents file creator whereas `Commiter` represents person who commited.

If the main branch has no change after you created second branch so merging both will overwrite the main branch and it is changed, it shows merge conflict.

# Tips

If file name is `Third.txt` and any other file name is not `Third`, you can use tab button to auto complete the name.

# Important things to remember

Always write filename with extension.

If you are tracking a file and then put it into .`gitignore` it will still tracking so you must have to untrack it.
